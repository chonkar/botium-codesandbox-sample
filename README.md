# Botium Sample running in Codesandbox.io

The index.js file is just here for serving up the test report generated by Botium to the browser.
It uses the "Mochawesome" reporter (https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome)

The "bot" directory contains a simple in-memory chatbot just returning some default texts, pictures and buttons

The "spec" directory contains the Botium convo files used to test the chatbot

To play around, you have to fork this sandbox.
