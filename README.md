# Botium Sample running in Codesandbox.io

The index.js file is just here for serving up the test report generated by Botium to the browser. It uses the "Mochawesome" reporter (https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome).

On the right side of the screen, please show up the Browser to view the generated test report.

The "bot under test" is just a simple in-memory chatbot returning some default texts, pictures and buttons.

The "spec" directory contains the Botium convo files used to test the chatbot.

To play around, change the convo files and rerun the Botium test cases, you have to fork this sandbox (see top left of this screen).
